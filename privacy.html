            of data in accordance with the following description. This website can generally be visited without
            registration. Data such as pages accessed or names of files accessed, date and time are stored on the server
            for statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your person. Personal data, in

            checked. We make every effort to ensure that the information we provide is up-to-date, correct and complete.
            Nevertheless, the occurrence of errors can not be completely excluded, so we can not guarantee the
            completeness, accuracy and timeliness of information, including journalistic-editorial nature. Liability
            claims regarding damage caused by the use of any information provided, including any kind of information
            which is incomplete or incorrect, will therefore be rejected.<br />The publisher may change or delete texts

            websites that can be accessed via external links on this website. The operators of the linked sites are
            solely responsible for their content. The publisher thus expressly distances itself from all third-party

            decency.<br /><br /><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br />The author assumes no liability for the correctness,
